# Discanner

## Description

Discanner is a map to show the places in Berlin, where people face different kind of discrimination in public spaces. Registered users can report these places with description and uploading a photo. After reporting a point a unique QRCode will generate for it. Users can print this QRCode and stick them in the city in order to bring a connection netween public spaces and virtual spaces. This project is my final project at Spiced Academy, which is done in one week.

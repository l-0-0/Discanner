1. we just use <form method="POST> for the application with routes, that the user clicks th sub,it button and 
    it goes to another page. for single page apps we don't need form tag. 

2. in our register.js we don't need to put anything in our state. the component makes them with this
    line of code:
    this.setState({
            [e.target.name]: e.target.value,
        });
